#150 local import/upload behavior (`src/skills-import.ts`, host routes and client controls) adapts the same pinned dsh-skills-manager v1.2.29 under Apache-2.0; checked ranges/local differences are in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. The existing complete Apache license is retained. `fflate` 0.8.3 (Copyright (c) 2026 Arjun Barrett, MIT) is a pinned external runtime dependency; no fflate source is embedded in generated output.

#146's conditional source-relative skill policy overlay adapts dsh-skills-manager v1.2.29, commit `49037a919b87b000de9003a49930425ae9742632`, under Apache License 2.0. The complete upstream license is retained in `skills/LICENSE-APACHE-2.0`; precise source ranges and local changes are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. Other skill-manager implementation is locally authored.

#147's registered-project and custom-source behavior (`src/skills-sources.ts`, the project and custom-source logic in `src/skills.ts`, and the matching controls in `src/skills-browser.ts`) adapts the same pinned reference under Apache License 2.0; ranges and local changes are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`.

#148's category, note and navigation-placement behavior (the corresponding logic in `src/skills.ts` and `src/skills-browser.ts`) adapts the same pinned reference under Apache License 2.0; ranges and local changes are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`.

#149's creation behavior and explicit-approval tool (`src/skills.ts` and `src/skills-browser.ts`) adapt the same pinned reference under Apache License 2.0; checked source ranges and local publication differences are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`.

#146 uses `yaml` 2.8.1 (Eemeli Aro, ISC License) to parse skill frontmatter. It is a pinned runtime dependency in `package.json`; the built `dist/skills.js` imports it as an external package and does not embed it.

#137 adapts OpenCode Zen client identification, free-lane catalog and gate schemas from https://github.com/FishBottle7/opencode2dsh `v0.3.14`, commit `1aa212063cf68b0ad6f3ed310bca4588cf06c008`. MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 FishBottle7. The complete MIT permission, inclusion condition and warranty disclaimer reproduced below apply to these adapted portions as well. See `src/PROVENANCE.md` for local changes.

#136's native API-provider UI narrowly adapts ModelsSection structure and styles from DeepSeek Harness `dsh-client-ui-settings-models` `0.2.1-rc.3`, https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness, under MIT. The precise source ranges and local adaptations are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. Controlled tests and public-remotes composition are locally authored.

#138 copies the general modules/addition icon (`icon.svg`) from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-plugin-market-bundle` `0.2.1-rc.5` in DeepSeek Harness (https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). The DeepSeek MIT copyright, permission and disclaimer below apply to this asset. Source and local usage are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`.

#135 additionally ports Google Antigravity OAuth/provider and Gemini-shaped request/schema/thinking/stream translation, with its reference behavior and visible-model quota-filter tests, from V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions v0.9.12 at `b8023110864494acefc6f5963c2a197d85dda20c` under MIT. The retained V1ki copyright and license in `src/PROVENANCE.md` apply; that record identifies owned lifecycle/composition and English/Arabic adaptations.

Subscriptions #128 adapts the exact authenticated Fetch RPC registration/envelope convention and closure-factory build recipe from [V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions](https://github.com/V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions), v0.9.12, commit b802311, MIT. Local changes and the license notice are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. That historical #128 slice contained no provider implementation. #129 additionally ports the pinned Codex and shared accounts/auth/translation/catalog/pool/retry code, compiled output and adapted tests; the exact inventory and local changes are recorded in `src/PROVENANCE.md`, together with the retained Copyright (c) 2026 V1ki MIT notice.

#130 additionally ports the pinned provider-settings, model-defaults, account-preferences, HTTP proxy, image account pool, Codex web-search provider, tool alias registration and the Codex-only `image_generate` tool, with adapted tests; the file-level map, the Codex-only changes and the excluded Grok/x_search/video surfaces are in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. The same copyright and MIT license apply.

The #129 visual correction additionally adapts the Codex presentation and helper styles from `src/client/SubscriptionsSection.tsx` and `src/client/provider-settings-styles.ts` at that same pin. Its scoped source map and render limitations are in `docs/ai/ticket-129-ui-parity.md`; the copyright/license above and in the provenance record continue to apply.

#131 additionally ports the composer usage badge, its display setting and preference store, the usage-window filter, the Speed control and the `/fast` command description from `src/client/` at that same pin, the `speed`/`setSpeed` host behavior from `src/auth/rpc.ts` and `src/index.ts`, and the matching tests; the file-level map is in `src/PROVENANCE.md` and the copyright/licence text above applies unchanged.

#132 additionally ports the pinned Claude provider, Anthropic translation, Claude CLI version detection and Claude Code credential reader from `src/providers/`, `src/translate/` and `src/auth/` at that same pin, adapts the Claude card, cache-lifetime Manage option and locale strings from `src/client/`, and ports the matching reference tests; the file-level map is in `src/PROVENANCE.md` and the copyright and MIT license above apply unchanged.

#133 additionally ports the pinned Grok provider, video and X tools, Grok image/edit extension, image gallery/lightbox and image/video toolviews, with reference tests. Owned namespace/storage, RPC, lifecycle and English/Arabic adaptations are inventoried in `src/PROVENANCE.md`. The same V1ki copyright and MIT license apply.

Ported source added by later components is listed here with its version, commit and the location of its provenance record. No provider account, trademark or service authorization follows from a code license.

#134 additionally ports GitHub Copilot, the device-flow engine, Chat Completions translation and their reference tests from the same v0.9.12 / b802311 MIT pin, with owned composition and EN/AR device-code card adaptations. See `src/PROVENANCE.md` for the inventory and local changes; the retained V1ki copyright and MIT notice apply.
