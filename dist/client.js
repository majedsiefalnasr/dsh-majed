/*
 * dsh-waycraft — Waycraft's DeepSeek Harness toolkit (client half).
 *
 * Nothing in DSH itself is modified: every feature below is added by this plugin
 * through public client extension points (slots + injected <style>/observers)
 * and is fully removed again when the plugin is disabled.
 *
 * Features
 *  1. Settings > General > "Bidirectional text"  (toggle)
 *       - per-paragraph direction for Arabic / Persian / Hebrew in chat,
 *         reasoning, tool cells, question boxes, user bubbles
 *         (replaces dsh-persian-rtl; CSS/logic adapted from it, MIT)
 *       - mirroring of @changfenhuang/dsh-genui components
 *  2. Settings > General > "App UI font size"   (px stepper, right after the chat font size)
 *  3. Settings > General > "App font"           (dropdown: DSH default / System font)
 *  4. Settings > General > "System notifications" (+ on completion / when action needed)
 *     Native desktop notifications driven by DSH's session status; click opens the session.
 *  7. Composer bar > "Approvals" dropdown: Ask me / Auto (safe) / Auto (aggressive), per session.
 *  6. Settings > General > "Copy on select" (toggle, off by default)
 *  5. Account menu grouping: sidebar footer buttons (Remote access, ...) move into the account menu.

       *   'ask'   — unknown / ambiguous: a human decides (the default for anything not recognised)
       *   'deny'  — matches a hard rule (destroys data, rewrites shared history, leaks secrets, escalates the
       *             machine); never auto-approved, even in "aggressive" mode's sibling "safe" mode.
       *
       * Principles (from Claude Code auto mode, Codex `is_safe_command`, anumati, Qwen auto-mode docs):
       *  - judge real effect, not surface text: a chain is safe only if EVERY segment is safe;
       *  - allow-list by shape (program + sub-command + flags), never "anything except X";
       *  - command substitution, eval, process substitution, here-docs and unknown redirects => not provable => ask;
       *  - hard-deny the irreversible / shared-state / secret / persistence classes regardless of intent.
       *
       * The module is plain ES5-ish JS so it can be inlined into the browser client and unit-tested in Node.
